## Setup & Usage
For point-transformer baseline, please follow [pytorch/README](https://github.com/LiyaoTang/contrastBoundary/tree/master/pytorch).

For ConvNet and other baselines, please follow [tensorflow/README](https://github.com/LiyaoTang/contrastBoundary/tree/master/tensorflow).

## Pre-trained models
Pretrained models can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_ppwnrAu6VRqENTPWPt-3KFqCCTtfsFC?usp=sharing), together with training and testing log. Choose the desired baseline and unzip into the corresponding code directory ([tensorflow](https://github.com/LiyaoTang/contrastBoundary/tree/master/tensorflow)/[pytorch](https://github.com/LiyaoTang/contrastBoundary/tree/master/pytorch)) and follow the README there for further instruction.
